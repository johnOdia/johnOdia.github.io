                        <p>
                            Hey! I'm <strong>John</strong>. Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps.
                            Learning
                            to
                            code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i> and a way to communicate with others on a
                            technical
                            level. I can also develop websites and use my coding skills to get a better job. I always
                            strive
                            to
                            improve on myself everyday and become a better version of myself with each passing day. This
                            drive/motivation has enabled me to take on new challenges head on. I find my motivation by
                            depending
                            on God.
                            <br> <br> "It always seems impossible until it's done" <br> <i>-Nelson Mandela</i>


                            I was born to a family 0f six and i'm the last of 4 children, 3 boys and a girl. I was raised in Benin city Edo state, and i love the rich cultural heritage that the city and the bini's possess. 

                            I studied Business Administration in the university of Benin where i graduated with a BSc in Business Administration. I learnt a lot from my course of study at the university. Primarily i learnt how to structure organizations into working smaller units and set goals for each. Also, i learnt that leadership is perhaps the most important skill that a manager needs to develop in order to be able to motivate surbordinates towards goal achievement. This skill has enabled me in my everyday life to work in teams.
                            <br> <br>
                            Finally, i fell in love with coding and building of applications during my service year in 2019 and i started with the basic web development course on sololearn where i earned certificates in html css and javascript. I also used resources like freecodecamp and codecademy to learn and improve my skills. The reason i went into coding was so that i will be very versatile in  app creation. So when i learnt that stutern offers a course on software engineering with a focus on react javascript it was a no brainer for me.
                            <br><br>
                            I belief that my education as a manager and my training as a software engineer will enable me to get to the apex of the software engineering profession. I've come to realize that the best software engineer is not just the person who writes the best code, but the person who is very productive and also able to effectively work in a team, this person is sometimes referred to as the <b>10x developer</b>. My goal is to become a  10x software developer. Checkout <a target="blank" href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/31673/10x-developer">this</a> techopedia article about the <b>10x developer</b>.
